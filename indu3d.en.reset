Have an idea but no clue how to develop it? Entrepreneurship but no specific idea?

This year’s edition of InduForum launches INDU3D, a creativity competition so you can shape your ideas and exploit your entrepreneurial talent.

Build a team and work for one day in an idea, business model or solution to a need. You will count on the help of young entrepreneurs and experts in the field of entrepreneurship, in addition to formative lectures from real experiences in entrepreneurship.

At the end of the day, you will have a few minutes to sell your offer to a jury consisting of an academic, an entrepreneur and an investor; the winner will get, among other things, a check for 300 € and valuable training for entrepreneurs from the Entrepreneurship Area of the Technical School of Madrid.
